# TreesADT
 This describes Trees ADT

A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) or data structure implementing this ADT that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children, represented as a set of linked nodes

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

Heap is a tree data structure which is implemented using arrays and used to implement priority queues. 
B-Tree and B+ Tree : They are used to implement indexing in databases. Syntax Tree: Used in Compilers. 
K-D Tree: A space partitioning tree used to organize points in K dimensional space.
