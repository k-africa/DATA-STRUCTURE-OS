# CircularLinkedList
 This is to describes iCircular linked lists

 In Circular linked list, all nodes are connected to form a circle. 
 There is no NULL at the end.
  A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.

Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
1. Any node can be a starting point.
2. Useful for implementation of queue. 
3. Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list. 
4. Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.

Application of Circular Linked List:
1. The real life application where the circular linked list is used is our Personal Computers, where multiple applications are running. ...
2. Another example can be Multiplayer games. ...
3. Circular Linked List can also be used to create Circular Queue.
