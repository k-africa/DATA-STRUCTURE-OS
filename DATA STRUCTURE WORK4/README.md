# SinglyLinkedList
 Description:
 The linked list is a linear data structure, that has a sequence of continuous nodes. A single node is just the object which contains things like, "data" and a "next" pointer which points to the next node in case of singly and circular linked list, and also "previous" pointer which will point to the previous node in case of a doubly linked list.
 
 Applications of Singly Linked List are as following:
  It is used to implement stacks and queues which are like fundamental needs throughout computer science.
  
 To prevent the collision between the data in the hash map, we use a singly linked list.
 
 If we ever noticed the functioning of a casual notepad, it also uses a singly linked list to perform undo or redo or deleting functions.
 We can think of its use in a photo viewer for having look at photos continuously in a slide show.
 
 In the system of train, the idea is like a singly linked list, as if you want to add a Boggie, either you have to take a new boggie to add at last or you must spot a place in between boggies and add it.
